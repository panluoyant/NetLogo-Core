  // Our class files are in Java 1.5 format, so there's no need in
  // this code to detect and reject older Java versions. Ideally the
  // app would have some Java 1.1 compatible startup code that would
  // check the Java version and then hand off to the real code.  We
  // have such code in the applet.  Doing it for the app doesn't
  // seem worth the effort given that we bundle Java 1.5 with the
  // app on Windows, and given that Apple bundles Java 1.5 with Mac
  // OS X.  (At least I think it was bundled with 10.4.0... even if
  // not, surely nearly every Mac user will have gotten it through
  // Software Update...)  - ST 2/25/08

  // It might also be nice to add some checks here for Mac users who
  // are not up to date with Java in Software Update, advising them
  // they should be.  At one point we had a similar check for Java 1.4,
  // but that was because we knew of some specific, crippling bugs.
  // We don't know about any of those in any of Apple's Java 1.5 releases,
  // so it seems OK to let it slide. - ST 2/25/08
